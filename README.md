* Config generator
* Super admin (able to view & undelete soft-deleted items)
* Improved image management
* Fully dynamic page routing (no restart required for Heroku)
* Backend Auditing (Who did what now?)
* Handle multi-user (Object Locking)
* Improved backend UI - Navigation should be at least partially visible on medium/large screens at all times
* Improved backend UI - Dashboard should contain stats and information

### Technical Debt
* Move list models into subfolder
* Tidy up implementation and create full specs for ListRenderer & ListItemRenderer
* Feature specs for all controller actions at the minimum checking for 200 status
* Add specs for frontend controllers
* Add specs for all configuration options
* All TODOs :)
